## Intro
Malcolm Young is widely regarded as a master rhythm guitarist. And honestly, until a few weeks ago I didn't pay much attention to him and AC/DC. But my ears have been opened to the genius and value of this band. And man, are those Young brothers incredible. Today is Malcolm's day!

## Simplicity and Groove
Malcolm plays 2 different riffs within the song, one for the verse, intro and chorus and another for the pre-chorus. 

### Riff 1 (Verse)

The riff lasts for one bar and in very AC/DC fashion, uses three chords, the I, IV and V, typical of the blues and rock. He starts with an E (0221xx) chord on the lower strings, followed by a D5 (xx023x) and an A5 (x022xx). The magic is of course in the groove. The hammer-on to E in the start of the bar and the energetic D5 to A5 pulls straight to next bar, never stopping. The alternation between the lower and high strings also keeps the riff fresh. The distorted, rich in mids tone, works perfectly with the band. And, straying away from the E string, there are no tiring highs in the sound.
Finally, as in the book [[Everyday Tonality - Phillip Tagg]], the chords do not work as individuals, but rather, the entire riff works as an ambience on which the song works and is always propelled forward. It is a place to be, not a journey, but man, is this place full of energy.

### Riff 1 (Chorus)

Here, Malcolm makes a small change to the rhythm, just to keep things fresh. And, Angus plays a complimentary line, on the lower strings which works incredibly well, filling the mix.

### Riff 2 (Pre-Chorus)

Here the structure is much longer. There are four bars of A5 in 2 forms (x022xx and x0423x) followed by 4 bars alternating B5 and E and D5 Malcolm. Each 2 bars, Malcolm alternates between long ringing chords and syncopated stabs adding notes. Of new harmonic material, he adds the 4th and 6th of the A and the ii (B5). Again, the trick is in the groove: the alternation of the longer notes and the syncopated hits propels the song forward without feeling tiring in any way. Here, Angus also compliments these lines and it feels pleasingly stereo. I guess Angus plays exactly the same line. 

### Technique

I just would like to emphasize how the rhythm lines sound powerful without much distortion, groovy without being stiff, hard on the notes, but without "noise". Malcolm plays the dirty notes in the cleanest way, without anything fancy and carries the song contageously. 

## Songwriting
The structure of the song works great and the energy and dynamics works really well. The melody feels really simple, and does not draw me.

## Conclusion
Reflecting on the beautiful rhythm guitar, the driving bass and drums and the great solo, along with my point about songwriting, there is a clear conclusion. Sometimes rock is more about a groove and really feeling it, and this song has got it, mostly because of the amazing work of Malcolm Young.
